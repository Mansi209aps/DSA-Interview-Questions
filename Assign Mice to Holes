10. Assign Mice to Holes

There are N Mice and N holes that are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
The positions of Mice are denoted by array A and the position of holes are denoted by array B.
A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

JAVA

public class Solution {
    public int mice(int[] A, int[] B) {
        Arrays.sort(A);
        Arrays.sort(B);
        int res=0;
        for(int i=0; i<A.length; i++){
            int diff = Math.abs(A[i]-B[i]);
            res = Math.max(res,diff);
        }
        return res;
    }
}

C++

int Solution::mice(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) {
    sort(A.begin(),A.end());
    sort(B.begin(),B.end());
    int res=0;
    for(int i=0; i<A.size(); i++){
        int diff=abs(A[i]-B[i]);
        res=max(res,diff);
    }
    return res;
}
